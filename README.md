# Chapter 1: Go to Vietnam
"You know what? My life's a pile of flaming garbage. Let’s spice it up by flying halfway across the world to Vietnam." No plan. No clue. Just vibes and enough cash for a one-way ticket. Brilliant idea, right? Yeah, not so much.
# Chapter 2: Eat bun dau mam tom
He rolls up to a tiny street vendor, and the old lady running it looks like she’s been waiting for an idiot like him her whole life. She serves him a plate of fried tofu, noodles, and this purple-gray sludge that smells like Satan's asshole after Taco Tuesday. "Mam tom," she says with a grin, like she’s about to watch a live episode of Fear Factor.
The first bite? Sweet fucking Christ. It’s like licking the bottom of a fish tank while someone farts in your face. His eyes water, his tongue burns, and he’s pretty sure he saw his soul leaving his body. Locals are laughing their asses off as this idiot tries to play it cool. "Yeah, it’s…uh…great!" he lies, choking back tears and regret.
# Chapter 3: Go home
After that culinary disaster, our hero decides he’s had enough of this "authentic experience" bullshit. He buys a ticket home, but not before getting scammed by a cab driver who charged him triple the fare. He didn’t even argue. Why? Because fuck it, that’s why.
Back at the airport, he’s sunburned, broke, and still smelling faintly of shrimp paste. "Never again," he mutters, boarding the plane.
### Post-Chapter 3:
But nah, life ain’t done kicking him in the balls yet. First, he opens his luggage and realizes that the shrimp paste smell has infected everything he owns. His clothes, his toothbrush, even his fucking laptop smells like rotting fish guts. Congrats, dumbass. You brought the stench of Vietnam home with you.
